# DCS Mission Plan

<!-- Replace with a screenshot of the landing "situation board" (e.g. docs/screenshots/landing.png) -->

> Prepare your DCS World missions end to end — a suite of tools behind one operational landing page. **Use it online, or download a single offline file.**

🌐 **[Use it online »](https://mirabellebenou.github.io/dcs-mission-plan/)** &nbsp;·&nbsp; 💾 **[Download the offline file »](../../releases)**

A single-page **"situation board"** that brings together a suite of mission-prep tools for DCS World virtual pilots and wings — staged like a Cold War operations table. Open the board, pick a tool, prepare your mission. It runs entirely in your browser: **online for those who don't want to download**, or as **one offline HTML file** you can keep, share, and use without internet.

Developped with the help of Claude AI (I'm not a dev !)

## 📱 Built for the tablet (and your phone)

Mission Plan is designed to be used **where you actually fly** — on a tablet next to your stick, or on your phone.

- **Touch-first UI** — large tap targets, drag-and-drop, no tiny desktop-only controls
- **Responsive layout** — split view on tablet/desktop, tabbed view on phone
- **Rotation-safe** — keeps working when you flip the tablet between landscape and portrait
- **No install** — open a link or a single file in the mobile browser; works offline once loaded
- **Export on the go** — generate PDF/PNG straight from the device

## 🧰 The suite

The landing page presents each tool as a **pinned print** on the board. Active tools open in place; upcoming ones are stamped *Coming soon*.

| Tool | What it does | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **HQ** | Command post — configure your wing once (branding, squadrons), shared with the other tools; experimental `.miz` mission reader/patcher | 🧪 Beta `v0.1.0` |
| **Briefing Generator** | Full mission briefings — SITAC, radio plan, airfields, charts, annexes — PDF & PNG export | ✅ `v2.2.0` |
| **Recon Station** | Turn a screenshot into a reconnaissance analysis photo — sensor looks, annotations, lossless PNG | ✅ `v1.0.0` |
| **Route Planner** | Route legs, turn points, interactive map and loadouts | ⏳ Planned |
| **Kneeboard Generator** | Printable kneeboard cards — frequencies, waypoints, checklists | ⏳ Planned |

> Each tool is a standalone HTML file with its own build; the landing page embeds the live tools and stages them all on one board.

### 🛡️ HQ — your wing, configured once

HQ is the suite's **command post**. Its main job today is the **wing hub**: set your wing name, logo, squadrons and callsigns **once**, and Briefing Generator + Recon Station pick it up automatically. HQ also ships an **experimental `.miz` engine** (read a mission, export a mission snapshot, apply surgical patches) — the advanced flight-package UI is still in development and in-game validation is pending, so HQ is published as **beta**.

### 🚀 Briefing Generator — in detail

Briefing Generator builds a **complete, shareable mission briefing** as a multi-section document, with **PDF and per-page PNG export** straight from the browser.

- **Sections** — cover, situation map (SITAC), charts, annexes, and mission phases
- **Radio & weather** — radio plan, METAR assistant, and **METAR import from a `.miz`**
- **Airfields** — structured airfield information
- **Wing branding** — pulled automatically from HQ (name, logo, squadrons)
- **Images** — drop in your own maps/charts; oversized images are auto-recompressed
- **4 themes, FR/EN**, multi-wing

### 🛰️ Recon Station — in detail

Recon Station turns any screenshot into a convincing **reconnaissance analysis photo**, fully in the browser, with **lossless full-resolution PNG export** (native Canvas 2D — what you preview is exactly what you export).

- **Sensor looks** — EO (default), IR white-hot, IR black-hot, SAR (stylizations, not radiometric data)
- **Image effects** — greyscale, contrast, vignette, grain, scanlines (sliders, off by default)
- **Annotations** — numbered movable markers, a magnifier/loupe (crops after effects), shapes (ellipse, rectangle, polygon, arrow, bracket), and labels (stamp, cursive grease-pencil, plain)
- **Editable info block** — 9 fields, bold text, black/white
- **Classification banner** — top/bottom bars, 4 levels, off by default
- **Wing logos** — upload manually or pull the shared wing branding from HQ; colour / grey / white modes

## ✨ Features

- **Online or fully offline** — use the hosted version, or one HTML file with no install, no server, no internet
- **One landing page** — embeds the live tools; open it, use it, share it
- **Tablet & mobile first** — see above 📱
- **4 graphical themes** — Cold War NATO (default), Cold War Soviet, Modern NATO, Modern Eastern Bloc — chosen on the board, carried across the tools
- **Bilingual** — full FR/EN toggle, shared across the suite
- **Configure your wing once** (HQ) — branding/squadrons shared with the other tools
- **PDF & PNG export** — straight from your browser
- **Auto-save** — your work is preserved in your browser's local storage

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Option A — online (nothing to download)**
1. Open **[the hosted version](https://mirabellebenou.github.io/dcs-mission-plan/)** in your browser (works on phone/tablet too)
2. Pick a tool on the board and go

**Option B — offline file**
1. Download the latest `dcs_mission_plan.html` from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome recommended) — on PC or tablet
3. It keeps working offline; bookmark or "Add to Home Screen" on mobile

No account, no internet required after the first load.

## 🛡️ For wing administrators

Customize the branding for your virtual wing — done once, in **HQ**, and shared with every tool:

1. Open **HQ** from the board
2. Set the wing name, logo, squadrons, callsigns
3. The configuration is shared automatically with Briefing Generator and Recon Station (and exportable to hand to your pilots)

The default `MY WING` configuration is generic — replace it with your own.

## 📓 Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the per-tool version history.

## 🏗️ Building from source

If you want to modify the code yourself.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (standard library only)

### Build
Each tool builds to a standalone HTML, then the landing page embeds the live tools:

```bash
# 1) Build the tools
python3 build_css.py && python3 build_html.py   # → DCS_World_Briefing_Generator.html
python3 build_recon_station.py                  # → dcs_recon_station.html
python3 build_hq.py                             # → dcs_hq.html

# 2) Assemble the landing page (embeds the tools + board tiles)
python3 build_mission_plan.py                   # → dcs_mission_plan.html
```

The output `dcs_mission_plan.html` is the distributable (and the file published online).
